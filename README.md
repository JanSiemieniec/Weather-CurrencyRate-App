# Weather-CurrencyRate-App
The app maybe is not the prittiest but practical. It's inform us about weather, currency rate and show wiki page about city.
In top we can see JSon about wheather from api.openweathermap.org
On the left we can see a converted currency from the currency in the city to the given currency from exchangerate.host
On the center we can see wiki page about city. 
On the right there is also converted currency from the currency in the city to the PLN from nbp.pl/ kursy/kursya.html /kursyb.html. 
On the bottom we can change city and currency.
